                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being
                    prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few
                    days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>Data on homelessness worldwide is varied, as the definition of homelessness differs from nation to
                    nation, and natural disasters and other crises can cause fluctuations in the number of homeless
                    individuals at a given time.1 In a global survey in 2005, the United Nations estimated the number of
                    homeless individuals worldwide to be over 100 million. Surveys struggle to account for homeless
                    populations living in slums, camps or other transitional forms of shelter — the “hidden homeless.

                <p>The importance of education cannot be overestimated, as it is the key to a bright and successful
                    future. At the Ri’ayah Foundation, it is our firm belief that all children deserve a chance to get a
                    quality education, as it is the best way for them to realize their true potential. Our focus is to
                    provide children with the opportunity to learn and develop, so they can grow up to be an integral
                    and healthy part of their communities.
